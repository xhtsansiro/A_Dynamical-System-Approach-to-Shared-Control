# A Dynamical System Approach to Shared Control

## Introduction

This project proposes a learning-based shared control approach which uses first order time invariant Dynamical Systems (DS) as motion generator and Variable Stiffness Dynamical Systems (VSDS) Controller as guidance generator. The proposed approach is considered for a teleoperation scenario, where the user interacts with the master device, controlling the remote robot to execute a specific task jointly. ![The overall architecture of the shared control approach](https://github.com/xhtsansiro/Shared_Control/blob/main/pics/Architecture_VSDS.png).

The proposed approach is validated in a target-reaching task, where
