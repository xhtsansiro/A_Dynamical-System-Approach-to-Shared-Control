# Data Analysis 

## Introduction


This Matlab project visualizes the proposed shared control approach, and analyzes the data of validation experiment and the data of user study. 

### Scripts
* [preprocessing.m](preprocessing.m): preprocess the original demonstration, generate Gaussian Process(GP) dataset.
* [gp_prediction.m](gp_prediction.m): Implement Gaussian Process Regression and visualize its performance.
* [gp_vsds.m](gp_vsds.m): Visualize the construction of Variable Stiffness Dynamical Systems (VSDS), and check the performance of VSDS used in a simple second order DS.
* [plot_all.m](plot_all.m): Generate all necessary plots to visualize results of validation experiment.  
* [analyze_userstudy.m](analyze_userstudy.m): Generate all necessary plots to visualize results of the user study.
* [video_generation.m](video_generation.m): Generate videos of the robot motion. 

### Folder 
* [data](data/): data of the validation experiment.
* [user_study](user_study/): data of the user study.
* [video](video/): videos generated by script [video_generation.m](video_generation.m).
